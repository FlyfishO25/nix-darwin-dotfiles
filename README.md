These are my configurations for class/android+kotlin programming respectively

.vimrc -> vim8 cofiguration writtten in only vimL. No dependencies 

init.lua -> neovim configuration 

Python: linters and snippets 
lsp: pyls (pip), kotlin_language_server (manually, add path to cmd)
Everything else should auto install through packer (:PackerSync)

Let me know if you would like me to add anything, and if there is a problem please feel free to open an issue
